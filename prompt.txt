i want to shift the backend to express node fully on server. like this is currently serverless. even want to create cron job running on server. so take reference from current project and build a seprate backend for this. no need of firebase shift to mongo db. Make the best optimised approach for this backend i want fully optimised backend and create a package.json file and strucutre where explain what dependencies are being used and why. write the code in es6+ format (import and export format not require). use latext syntaxes search web if needed
